# Project 5:  A Script which extracts data from desired columns and plots the data in scatter plots with pandas.

# A) Dataset
The data set I have chosen for this project entails the Salaries and Sales figures of several Financial professionals
throughout  the biggest cities in the world.

The source for the data set can be found through the following link:

# B) Columns of Interest

Out of the four columns, the sales and salary columns were extracted and were the x and y of the scatter plot and hence
the distribution observed in the figure. The location column was also used to make the distribution appear distinguished
as it allocates the data sets to the cities and separates them by shape and colour as they appear.

the column salary was also used to sort the data points by size as well adding to the visual distinction. How this
is important for a financial analyst and what the correlations pertain is not of interest of this project as I can't
accurately give explanations to these parameters since it's not my area of field. So as a Disclaimer, this should not be
taken as any source of intelligent information to be used and interpreted but rather as a demonstration of extracting
data and making a scatter plot out of it

# C) Tools

Python code: I used Pycharm as a platform to write the code
